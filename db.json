I used to confuse the \"cover\" and the \"mask\" because a \"mask\" might always \"cover\" the face. However, the expression \"vowel modification\" in English or \"元音修正\" in Chinese might be the preferable translation of *copertura*, the italian origin of \"covering (遮盖)\".\n\n\n### Copertura\nFirstly, it should be known that the well-balanced resonance or a *chiaroscuro* (light-dark) timbre should be \"maintained among harmonic partials in all parts of the spectrum regardless of the vowel or the pitch being sung.\" and ***copertura*** is the way to achieve it. \"*Copertura* is best described as the process of conscious equalization of the ascending scale through vowel modification so as to diminish register demarcations, not to exaggerate them.\" It is a technique of subtle adjustment (*aggiustamento*) of vocal timbre that produces the equalized scale in mounting pitch.\" *Copertura* serves in upper-middle and upper ranges of the singing voice. It gradually processes the voice in the *zona di passaggio* (passage zone or 换声点) to avoid the sudden registration shifts in upper-middle voice, and additional vowel modification takes place in the upper range (*voce di testa*). In the modern international school, moderate vowel modification is initiated at the *primo passaggio* near the termination of the speech range, and additional but gradual modification of the vowel takes place as the scale approaches the *secondo passaggio*.\n\n*Voce chiusa* (closed voice) and *voce aperta* (open voice) are a pair of comparable timbres while the former one is desirable. *Voce coperta* (covered voice) can only be present with *copertura* using *aggiustamento*. The *copertura* helps maintain the *voce chiusa* as pitch mounts, especially is important in the *zona di passaggio*. With *copertura*, the vowel should still be recognizable and maintains its own integrity while at the same time involves *unconscious* laryngeal and supraglottic alteration.  When a singer processes a series of vowels, he may perceive the resonance changes. For example, many young singers might feel \"[a] falls back\". \"In contrast to such a proprioceptive response, the singer's formant (spectral energy in the area of 2500 Hz to 3200 Hz in the male voice) and strong acoustic energy in the upper spectrum of female voices should always be present in both lateral and rounded vowels. This can happen only if the resonators are in tune with the vibrator. This balanced relationship among the fundamental pitch, the appropriate vowel formants and the acoustic energy in the region of the singer's formant, produces the *chiaroscuro* timbre of the historic Italianate model. In order, then, to keep the desired acoustic equilibrium as pitch ascends, modification of the vowel must occur.\" \n\nThe supraglottic region alters in ascending pitch and the alteration includes subconscious activity in pharyngeal wall movement, at the base of the tongue as well as in the body of the tongue, in the shape of the pyriform sinuses, and the in epiglottic movement. Epiglottic movement unconsciously occurs in response to tongue action. In general, the epiglottis is more erect in  the vowel [i] than in any other and the lowering process of epiglottis, playing a kind of filtering role within the vocal tract,  is a certain physiologic basis for traditional pedagogical terms that mean to \"cover\", though the phenomenon's implication for vocal technique is still unsure.\n\nIt should be noticed that different singer have the vowel modified at slightly different pitches. In both female and male instruments, most vowel modification in ascending pitch is in the direction of lateral to rounded vowel.

I used to confuse the \"cover\" and the \"mask\" because a \"mask\" might always \"cover\" the face. However, the expression \"vowel modification\" in English or \"元音修正\" in Chinese might be the preferable translation of *copertura*, the italian origin of \"covering (遮盖)\".\n\n\n### Copertura\nFirstly, it should be known that the well-balanced resonance or a *chiaroscuro* (light-dark) timbre should be \"maintained among harmonic partials in all parts of the spectrum regardless of the vowel or the pitch being sung.\" and ***copertura*** is the way to achieve it. \"*Copertura* is best described as the process of conscious equalization of the ascending scale through vowel modification so as to diminish register demarcations, not to exaggerate them.\" It is a technique of subtle adjustment (*aggiustamento*) of vocal timbre that produces the equalized scale in mounting pitch.\" *Copertura* serves in upper-middle and upper ranges of the singing voice. It gradually processes the voice in the *zona di passaggio* (passage zone or 换声点) to avoid the sudden registration shifts in upper-middle voice, and additional vowel modification takes place in the upper range (*voce di testa*). In the modern international school, moderate vowel modification is initiated at the *primo passaggio* near the termination of the speech range, and additional but gradual modification of the vowel takes place as the scale approaches the *secondo passaggio*.\n\n*Voce chiusa* (closed voice) and *voce aperta* (open voice) are a pair of comparable timbres while the former one is desirable. *Voce coperta* (covered voice) can only be present with *copertura* using *aggiustamento*. The *copertura* helps maintain the *voce chiusa* as pitch mounts, especially is important in the *zona di passaggio*. With *copertura*, the vowel should still be recognizable and maintains its own integrity while at the same time involves *unconscious* laryngeal and supraglottic alteration.  When a singer processes a series of vowels, he may perceive the resonance changes. For example, many young singers might feel \"[a] falls back\". \"In contrast to such a proprioceptive response, the singer's formant (spectral energy in the area of 2500 Hz to 3200 Hz in the male voice) and strong acoustic energy in the upper spectrum of female voices should always be present in both lateral and rounded vowels. This can happen only if the resonators are in tune with the vibrator. This balanced relationship among the fundamental pitch, the appropriate vowel formants and the acoustic energy in the region of the singer's formant, produces the *chiaroscuro* timbre of the historic Italianate model. In order, then, to keep the desired acoustic equilibrium as pitch ascends, modification of the vowel must occur.\" \n\nThe supraglottic region alters in ascending pitch and the alteration includes subconscious activity in pharyngeal wall movement, at the base of the tongue as well as in the body of the tongue, in the shape of the pyriform sinuses, and the in epiglottic movement.

The modes could be decided by the glottal resistance which equals the breath pressure by the airflow. The mode could be:\n- **pressed phonation**: high resistance; stronger high harmonics; \"metallic\", \"overly bright\",\n- **breathy phonation**: low resistance; weaker high harmonics; \"airy\", \"fluty\",\n- **flow phonation**: moderate resistance.\n\nDifferent from the modes of [CVT (Complete Vocal Technique)](https://completevocal.institute/), which is about the register and sound production mechanisms, including neutral, curbing, overdrive, and edge. The modes here is about phonation. It is more related to the sound, which is the results of different mechanisms, instead of the mechanisms itself.\n\nThe **laryngeal register** refers to the muscular adjustment of the vocal folds for pitch regulation, which is primarily controlled by:\n- **the thyroarytenoids** (TA): vocal fold shortening, thickening vocal fold muscles.\n- **the cricothyroids** (CT): vocal fold stretching, thinning muscles that lie partly outside the larynx.\n\nTwo laryngeal registers list here are:\n- **chestier** (shorter, thicker vocal folds), more and stronger high harmonics <-- the more complex pressure form <-- vertical phase difference <-- thicker vocal folds <-- TA,\n- **headier** (longer, thinner vocal folds), fewer and weaker high harmonics <-- more sinusoidal pressure wave <-- little to no vertical phase difference <-- thinner vocal folds <-- CT.\n\nThe chestier and headier register might correspond to the modal voice and falsetto voice register, respectively, in the four-register system together with the vocal fry register and the whistle register.\n\nHere the word **register** should be carefully used, which is determined by three key elements: \n1. A register is composed of contiguous pitches;\n2. Pitches within any given register are produced in the same physiological manner;\n3.

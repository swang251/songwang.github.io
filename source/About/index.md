I am now a PhD candidate at [Computational Acoustic Modeling Laboratory (CAML)](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/caml/doku.php?id=home), Schulich School of Music, McGill University.

My research interests are musical instrument acoustics and computational (aero)acoustics. I am currently working on the project of [Analysis and Design of Saxophone Mouthpieces](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/caml/doku.php?id=projects:adsm).

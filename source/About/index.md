I am now a PhD candidate at Computational Acoustic Modeling Group (CAML), Schulich School of Music, McGill University.

My current research interests are musical instrument acoustics and computational (aero)acoustics. I am now using lattice Boltzmann method, based on the open-source CFD solver [Palabos](http://www.palabos.org/), to study the aeroacoustic and fluid-solid interaction problems of single-reed instruments, especially the influence of different geometries to the fluid properties, e.g., vortices and turbulence, and so to the acoustics.

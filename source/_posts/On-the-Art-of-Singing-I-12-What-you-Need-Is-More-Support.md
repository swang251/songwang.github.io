Richard told us an interesting story that he has experienced. In a vocal lesson, a nineteen-year-old baritone sings the *Gia il sole dal Gange* exhibiting extreme nasality. His teacher tried different suggestions, "singing forward", "masque", "concentrate on forehead", "calvaria and chimney on the top", "funnel", "sing it to yourself", "give it more support", which however turns out to the same result - the student exhibits the same degree of nasality as previously.

As we can learn from the story, 
> As in so many cases, imaginative "placement" and "support" notions could not be trusted to remedy functional inadequacies present in the singing technique. 

Without sepcific information as to the physiologic and acoustic causes of the problem, one can not be expected to know how to revise it in singing. "You need more support" will not be the ultimate panacea for all vocal faults regardless of their origin.

By the way, as pointed by Richard, 
> Such nasal timbre is the result, of course, of a constantly low velar position that does not take into account the postures necessary for non-nasal vowel and non-nasal voiced consonant definition.

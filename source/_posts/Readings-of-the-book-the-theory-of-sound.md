### II. Historical development of acoustics to the time of Rayleigh

Sound is important. The science of sound is known as acoustics. However, the history of acoustics has been largely a neglected subject. At very early stage, the ancient Greeks proposed the basic theory of acoustics in substatially the form which we accept today. It is even more clear compared with the ancient views on the other mechanic branches. However, unlike the continuously development of the other branches, the basic theory of acoustics laid down early and tends to be merged in the larger development of mechanics as a whole. This article helps review the history of acoustics.

The problems of acoustics are divided into three main groups, viz.
- the production of sound
- the propagation of sound
- the reception of sound.

#### The production of sound
It is usually assumed that the first Greek philosopher to study the origin of musical sounds was Pythagoras in the 6th century B.C., who found that the longer the string, the lower the note.

The frequency concept emerged in the time of Galileo Galilei (1564-1641), the founder of modern physics.

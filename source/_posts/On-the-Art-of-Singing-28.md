Two factors to form the basis of all good technical singing are *sostenuto* and *coloratura*, literally meaning "sustained" and "coloring" in English. 

In the form of the operatic *[scena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_aria)*, *cavatina* and *cabaletta* exhibite, in which the singer was expected to show the two chief technical facets of skillful singing: *legato* and *agility*.

These two vocal techniques are Siamese twins. One completes the other cannot exist without the other.

Examples of *scene* or "double arias": Handel's *Piangerò*. Mozart's *Non mi dir*, Bellini's *Non mi credea*, and Verdi's *Ah! fors'è lui!*

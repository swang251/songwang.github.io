In this chapter, the author talks about the "covering (遮盖)" which is another important and widely used term in most vocal pedagogies while the word itself is confusing and misleading. I used to confuse the "cover" and the "mask" because a "mask" always "covers" the face. However, the *copertura*, the origin of "cover", may be preferable to use the expression "vowel modification" in English or "元音修改" in Chinese.

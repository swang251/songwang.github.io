    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>mode of phonation</strong> relates to three factors: breath pressure, airflow, and glottal resistance. The modes could be decided by the glottal resistance which equals the breath pressure by the airflow. The mode could be:</p><ul><li><strong>pressed phonation</strong>: high resistance; stronger high harmonics; “metallic”, “overly bright”,</li><li><strong>breathy phonation</strong>: low resistance; weaker high harmonics; “airy”, “fluty”,</li><li><strong>flow phonation</strong>: moderate resistance.</li></ul><p>Different from the modes of <a href="https://completevocal.institute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVT (Complete Vocal Technique)</a>, which is about the register and sound production mechanisms, including neutral, curbing, overdrive, and edge. The modes here is about phonation. It is more related to the sound, which is the results of different mechanisms, instead of the mechanisms itself.</p><p>The <strong>laryngeal register</strong> refers to the muscular adjustment of the vocal folds for pitch regulation, which is primarily controlled by:</p><ul><li><strong>the thyroarytenoids</strong> (TA): vocal fold shortening, thickening vocal fold muscles.</li><li><strong>the cricothyroids</strong> (CT): vocal fold stretching, thinning muscles that lie partly outside the larynx.</li></ul><p>Two laryngeal registers list here are:</p><ul><li><strong>chestier</strong> (shorter, thicker vocal folds), more and stronger high harmonics &lt;– the more complex pressure form &lt;– vertical phase difference &lt;– thicker vocal folds &lt;– TA,</li><li><strong>headier</strong> (longer, thinner vocal folds), fewer and weaker high harmonics &lt;– more sinusoidal pressure wave &lt;– little to no vertical phase difference &lt;– thinner vocal folds &lt;– CT.</li></ul><p>The chestier and headier register might correspond to the modal voice and falsetto voice register, respectively, in the four-register system together with the vocal fry register and the whistle register.</p><p>Here the word <strong>register</strong> should be carefully used, which is determined by three key elements: </p><ol><li>A register is composed of contiguous pitches;</li><li>Pitches within any given register are produced in the same physiological manner;</li><li>Pitches within any given register share the same basic timbre.</li></ol><blockquote><p>By the word register we mean a series of consecutive and homogeneous tones going from low to high, produced by the development of the same mechanical principle, and whose nature differs essentially from another series of tones, equally consecutive and homogeneous, produced by another mechanical principle (Garcia, 1847)</p></blockquote>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a 10-year-chorister, this article resolves some of my confusions. Especially what is claimed at the very beginning, there is no difference nor conflict between the training of the solo voice and that of a chorister. Even though, the voice today in modern music conservatories are different from the one of Josquin, Palestrina, or Gesualdo.</p><p>In traditional choral literature, it is required to be “blend” at all <em>tessitura</em> and dynamic levels which might be problematic because of the unbalanced voices between the professionals and amateurs and the unique timbre characteristics of each vocal instrument. What might be worse is that trying to submerge the voice into the surrounding bland sound threats to the professionals’ vocal health. In order to solve such problem, the choral conductor should pursue the balancing voices instead of the blend voices. </p><p>The choral conductor is responsible to teach the choristers how to become efficient singers. “It is not necessary to be a professional singer in order to be a fine teacher of singing, but it is necessary that one achieve a good level of technical proficiency with one’s own instrument.” Three main areas of vocal technique should be developed including <em>breath management/appoggio</em> (onset, agility, and sostenuto exercises), <em>free laryngeal function</em> (vibrato) and <em>resonance balancing</em> (vowel definition exercises). </p><p>Here below are some useful points:</p><ul><li>At the cessation of each sound, the vocal folds and the breath should be replenished in a synergistic manner.</li><li>In all onset, agility, and sostenuto exercises, the abdominal wall, although flexible while articulating the laughter-like impulses, remains stable and neither pulls inward nor presses outward at the moment of onset.</li><li>Many tuning problems in choral ensembles are the consequence of the singers’ inability to clearly differentiate vowels.</li><li>Dropping the jaw tends to narrow the pharynx.</li><li>Singers need to learn to “track the vowel” by changing the shapes of the vocal tract to the corresponding target vowel and the laryngeal configuration.</li><li>The particular vowel, the tessitura, and the intensity determine the degree of jaw opening (and also the form of all the articulators).</li><li>An even vibrato, the result of relaxant laryngeal function, is an inherent characteristic of freely produced vocal sound which should not be avoided in a choir. However, of course, a too wide and too slow “wobble” sound or a too narrow and too swift vibrato should be avoided.</li><li>Musical accuracy is the major priority for each choral director.</li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article discusses the relationship between the diction and the vocal technique. </p><p>The singing tone is not the results of a universal, neutral timbre superimposed by a series of vowels. Instead, the tone, or acoustically the timbre, or physiologically the shape of the articulators, should be adjusted based on the difference of the vowel. The diction does not exist as a separate entity from the tone. The shapes of the resonator (vocal tract) keep matching that of the generator (larynx). </p><blockquote><p>For the singing voice, as for the speaking voice, neither undistorted tone nor recognizable diction can be superimposed on a single predetermined acoustic posture. As spectrum analysis demonstrates, diction need not be inimical to tone, because it is part of the timbre balance.</p></blockquote><p>In addition, as claimed by the Richard, “the clean diction is not produced by exaggerated, heavy consonants, but by quickly occurring consonants (except for consonantal doubling in languages that require it) that do not impede the connected flow of well-defined vowels.” This point deserves more notice as we are always required to exaggerate the consonant in order to make it audible to the audience. However, the key point for a clear and clean diction is the <strong>flow connection</strong> of the vowels. That means <em>the consonant should never disturb the continuous matching adjustment of the larynx and the vocal tract</em>.</p><p>As a conclusion, we should keep in mind that <strong>vowel is the timbre</strong>.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a id="more"></a><p>In this chapter, the author talks about the “covering (遮盖)” which is another important and widely used term in most vocal pedagogies while the word itself is confusing and misleading. I used to confuse the “cover” and the “mask” because a “mask” might always “cover” the face. However, the expression “vowel modification” in English or “元音修正” in Chinese might be the preferable translation of <em>copertura</em>, the italian origin of “covering (遮盖)”.</p><h3 id="Copertura"><a href="#Copertura" class="headerlink" title="Copertura"></a>Copertura</h3><p>Firstly, it should be known that the well-balanced resonance or a <em>chiaroscuro</em> (light-dark) timbre should be “maintained among harmonic partials in all parts of the spectrum regardless of the vowel or the pitch being sung.” and <strong><em>copertura</em></strong> is the way to achieve it. “<em>Copertura</em> is best described as the process of conscious equalization of the ascending scale through vowel modification so as to diminish register demarcations, not to exaggerate them.” It is a technique of subtle adjustment (<em>aggiustamento</em>) of vocal timbre that produces the equalized scale in mounting pitch.” <em>Copertura</em> serves in upper-middle and upper ranges of the singing voice. It gradually processes the voice in the <em>zona di passaggio</em> (passage zone or 换声点) to avoid the sudden registration shifts in upper-middle voice, and additional vowel modification takes place in the upper range (<em>voce di testa</em>). In the modern international school, moderate vowel modification is initiated at the <em>primo passaggio</em> near the termination of the speech range, and additional but gradual modification of the vowel takes place as the scale approaches the <em>secondo passaggio</em>.</p><p><em>Voce chiusa</em> (closed voice) and <em>voce aperta</em> (open voice) are a pair of comparable timbres while the former one is desirable. <em>Voce coperta</em> (covered voice) can only be present with <em>copertura</em> using <em>aggiustamento</em>. The <em>copertura</em> helps maintain the <em>voce chiusa</em> as pitch mounts, especially is important in the <em>zona di passaggio</em>. With <em>copertura</em>, the vowel should still be recognizable and maintains its own integrity while at the same time involves <em>unconscious</em> laryngeal and supraglottic alteration.  When a singer processes a series of vowels, he may perceive the resonance changes. For example, many young singers might feel “[a] falls back”. “In contrast to such a proprioceptive response, the singer’s formant (spectral energy in the area of 2500 Hz to 3200 Hz in the male voice) and strong acoustic energy in the upper spectrum of female voices should always be present in both lateral and rounded vowels. This can happen only if the resonators are in tune with the vibrator. This balanced relationship among the fundamental pitch, the appropriate vowel formants and the acoustic energy in the region of the singer’s formant, produces the <em>chiaroscuro</em> timbre of the historic Italianate model. In order, then, to keep the desired acoustic equilibrium as pitch ascends, modification of the vowel must occur.” </p><p>The supraglottic region alters in ascending pitch and the alteration includes subconscious activity in pharyngeal wall movement, at the base of the tongue as well as in the body of the tongue, in the shape of the pyriform sinuses, and the in epiglottic movement. Epiglottic movement unconsciously occurs in response to tongue action. In general, the epiglottis is more erect in  the vowel [i] than in any other and the lowering process of epiglottis, playing a kind of filtering role within the vocal tract,  is a certain physiologic basis for traditional pedagogical terms that mean to “cover”, though the phenomenon’s implication for vocal technique is still unsure.</p><p>It should be noticed that different singer have the vowel modified at slightly different pitches. In both female and male instruments, most vowel modification in ascending pitch is in the direction of lateral to rounded vowel. In the process of modifying the vowel, it should be kept in mind that lateral vowels tend to augment high formants and that rounded vowels strengthen low formants.</p><h3 id="The-difference-between-heavy-cover-and-cover"><a href="#The-difference-between-heavy-cover-and-cover" class="headerlink" title="The difference between heavy cover and cover."></a>The difference between <em>heavy cover</em> and <em>cover</em>.</h3><ul><li>“Techniques of ‘heavy cover’ generally are associated with breath management maneuvers that involve muscular antagonism in the hypogastric region of the abdominal wall,” which is characterized by the drastic change of laryngeal position. </li><li>However, <em>copertura</em> is based on <em>appoggio</em> model (to lean on something) during which, the inspiratory position of the abdominal wall is less quickly altered than is the case in several other “support” techniques, while axial posture remains unaltered.<ul><li>“In the union of the <em>appoggio</em> and the <em>aggiustamento (copertura)</em> maneuvers, radical changes do not occur at register demarcation points either in the anterolateral abdominal wall or in sternal positioning, nor in the resonator tract, as is the case in some other systems. As a result, the larynx remains in a stable position throughout the <em>copertura</em> process, maintaining its relatively low, poised position regardless of register events.”</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="The-differences-between-“Covering”-in-different-areas"><a href="#The-differences-between-“Covering”-in-different-areas" class="headerlink" title="The differences between “Covering” in different areas"></a>The differences between “Covering” in different areas</h3><p><em>Copertura</em> is equated by <em>Deckung</em> in German and <em>couverture</em> in French. So in different areas, <em>copertura</em> means different things:</p><ul><li>Traditional Germanic school (as well as its Nordic and Middle European derivatives and the influenced Asian adherents and the American vocal pedagogy): <em>Deckung</em> (cover) demands sudden mechanical registration actions while there has always existed a reaction against “heavy covering”.</li><li>Current French School: <ul><li>historic French School: <em>couverture</em> = <em>copertura</em>.</li><li>Since World War II: influenced by <em>Deckung</em>.</li></ul></li><li>Great Britain: Great diversity of tonal ideals exist and the two extremes are<ul><li>“Cathedral tone”: “‘covering’ is not a concern because high levels of breath mixture in the tone have already reduced the upper partials in the singing voice.”</li><li>British-trained opera and concert singers: similar to the international operatic stage.</li></ul></li></ul>]]></content>

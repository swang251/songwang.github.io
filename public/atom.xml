    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a 10-year-chorister, this article resolves some of my confusions. Especially what is claimed at the very beginning, there is no difference nor conflict between the training of the solo voice and that of a chorister. Even though, the voice today in modern music conservatories are different from the one of Josquin, Palestrina, or Gesualdo.</p><p>In traditional choral literature, it is required to be “blend” at all <em>tessitura</em> and dynamic levels which might be problematic because of the unbalanced voices between the professionals and amateurs and the unique timbre characteristics of each vocal instrument. What might be worse is that trying to submerge the voice into the surrounding bland sound threats to the professionals’ vocal health. In order to solve such problem, the choral conductor should pursue the balancing voices instead of the blend voices. </p><p>The choral conductor is responsible to teach the choristers how to become efficient singers. “It is not necessary to be a professional singer in order to be a fine teacher of singing, but it is necessary that one achieve a good level of technical proficiency with one’s own instrument.” Three main areas of vocal technique should be developed including <em>breath management/appoggio</em> (onset, agility, and sostenuto exercises), <em>free laryngeal function</em> (vibrato) and <em>resonance balancing</em> (vowel definition exercises). </p><p>Here below are some useful points:</p><ul><li>At the cessation of each sound, the vocal folds and the breath should be replenished in a synergistic manner.</li><li>In all onset, agility, and sostenuto exercises, the abdominal wall, although flexible while articulating the laughter-like impulses, remains stable and neither pulls inward nor presses outward at the moment of onset.</li><li>Many tuning problems in choral ensembles are the consequence of the singers’ inability to clearly differentiate vowels.</li><li>Dropping the jaw tends to narrow the pharynx.</li><li>Singers need to learn to “track the vowel” by changing the shapes of the vocal tract to the corresponding target vowel and the laryngeal configuration.</li><li>The particular vowel, the tessitura, and the intensity determine the degree of jaw opening (and also the form of all the articulators).</li><li>An even vibrato, the result of relaxant laryngeal function, is an inherent characteristic of freely produced vocal sound which should not be avoided in a choir. However, of course, a too wide and too slow “wobble” sound or a too narrow and too swift vibrato should be avoided.</li><li>Musical accuracy is the major priority for each choral director.</li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article discusses the relationship between the diction and the vocal technique. </p><p>The singing tone is not the results of a universal, neutral timbre superimposed by a series of vowels. Instead, the tone, or acoustically the timbre, or physiologically the shape of the articulators, should be adjusted based on the difference of the vowel. The diction does not exist as a separate entity from the tone. The shapes of the resonator (vocal tract) keep matching that of the generator (larynx). </p><blockquote><p>For the singing voice, as for the speaking voice, neither undistorted tone nor recognizable diction can be superimposed on a single predetermined acoustic posture. As spectrum analysis demonstrates, diction need not be inimical to tone, because it is part of the timbre balance.</p></blockquote><p>In addition, as claimed by the Richard, “the clean diction is not produced by exaggerated, heavy consonants, but by quickly occurring consonants (except for consonantal doubling in languages that require it) that do not impede the connected flow of well-defined vowels.” This point deserves more notice as we are always required to exaggerate the consonant in order to make it audible to the audience. However, the key point for a clear and clean diction is the <strong>flow connection</strong> of the vowels. That means <em>the consonant should never disturb the continuous matching adjustment of the larynx and the vocal tract</em>.</p><p>As a conclusion, we should keep in mind that <strong>vowel is the timbre</strong>.</p>]]></content>

    <title>On the Art of Singing I-3 Covering in the Singing Voice</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<a id="more"></a><p>In this chapter, the author talks about the “covering (遮盖)” which is another important and widely used term in most vocal pedagogies while the word itself is confusing and misleading. I used to confuse the “cover” and the “mask” because a “mask” might always “cover” the face. However, the expression “vowel modification” in English or “元音修正” in Chinese might be the preferable translation of <em>copertura</em>, the italian origin of “covering (遮盖)”.</p><h3 id="Copertura"><a href="#Copertura" class="headerlink" title="Copertura"></a>Copertura</h3><p>Firstly, it should be known that the well-balanced resonance or a <em>chiaroscuro</em> (light-dark) timbre should be “maintained among harmonic partials in all parts of the spectrum regardless of the vowel or the pitch being sung.” and <strong><em>copertura</em></strong> is the way to achieve it. “<em>Copertura</em> is best described as the process of conscious equalization of the ascending scale through vowel modification so as to diminish register demarcations, not to exaggerate them.” It is a technique of subtle adjustment (<em>aggiustamento</em>) of vocal timbre that produces the equalized scale in mounting pitch.” <em>Copertura</em> serves in upper-middle and upper ranges of the singing voice. It gradually processes the voice in the <em>zona di passaggio</em> (passage zone or 换声点) to avoid the sudden registration shifts in upper-middle voice, and additional vowel modification takes place in the upper range (<em>voce di testa</em>). In the modern international school, moderate vowel modification is initiated at the <em>primo passaggio</em> near the termination of the speech range, and additional but gradual modification of the vowel takes place as the scale approaches the <em>secondo passaggio</em>.</p><p><em>Voce chiusa</em> (closed voice) and <em>voce aperta</em> (open voice) are a pair of comparable timbres while the former one is desirable. <em>Voce coperta</em> (covered voice) can only be present with <em>copertura</em> using <em>aggiustamento</em>. The <em>copertura</em> helps maintain the <em>voce chiusa</em> as pitch mounts, especially is important in the <em>zona di passaggio</em>. With <em>copertura</em>, the vowel should still be recognizable and maintains its own integrity while at the same time involves <em>unconscious</em> laryngeal and supraglottic alteration.  When a singer processes a series of vowels, he may perceive the resonance changes. For example, many young singers might feel “[a] falls back”. “In contrast to such a proprioceptive response, the singer’s formant (spectral energy in the area of 2500 Hz to 3200 Hz in the male voice) and strong acoustic energy in the upper spectrum of female voices should always be present in both lateral and rounded vowels. This can happen only if the resonators are in tune with the vibrator. This balanced relationship among the fundamental pitch, the appropriate vowel formants and the acoustic energy in the region of the singer’s formant, produces the <em>chiaroscuro</em> timbre of the historic Italianate model. In order, then, to keep the desired acoustic equilibrium as pitch ascends, modification of the vowel must occur.” </p><p>The supraglottic region alters in ascending pitch and the alteration includes subconscious activity in pharyngeal wall movement, at the base of the tongue as well as in the body of the tongue, in the shape of the pyriform sinuses, and the in epiglottic movement. Epiglottic movement unconsciously occurs in response to tongue action. In general, the epiglottis is more erect in  the vowel [i] than in any other and the lowering process of epiglottis, playing a kind of filtering role within the vocal tract,  is a certain physiologic basis for traditional pedagogical terms that mean to “cover”, though the phenomenon’s implication for vocal technique is still unsure.</p><p>It should be noticed that different singer have the vowel modified at slightly different pitches. In both female and male instruments, most vowel modification in ascending pitch is in the direction of lateral to rounded vowel. In the process of modifying the vowel, it should be kept in mind that lateral vowels tend to augment high formants and that rounded vowels strengthen low formants.</p><h3 id="The-difference-between-heavy-cover-and-cover"><a href="#The-difference-between-heavy-cover-and-cover" class="headerlink" title="The difference between heavy cover and cover."></a>The difference between <em>heavy cover</em> and <em>cover</em>.</h3><ul><li>“Techniques of ‘heavy cover’ generally are associated with breath management maneuvers that involve muscular antagonism in the hypogastric region of the abdominal wall,” which is characterized by the drastic change of laryngeal position. </li><li>However, <em>copertura</em> is based on <em>appoggio</em> model (to lean on something) during which, the inspiratory position of the abdominal wall is less quickly altered than is the case in several other “support” techniques, while axial posture remains unaltered.<ul><li>“In the union of the <em>appoggio</em> and the <em>aggiustamento (copertura)</em> maneuvers, radical changes do not occur at register demarcation points either in the anterolateral abdominal wall or in sternal positioning, nor in the resonator tract, as is the case in some other systems. As a result, the larynx remains in a stable position throughout the <em>copertura</em> process, maintaining its relatively low, poised position regardless of register events.”</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="The-differences-between-“Covering”-in-different-areas"><a href="#The-differences-between-“Covering”-in-different-areas" class="headerlink" title="The differences between “Covering” in different areas"></a>The differences between “Covering” in different areas</h3><p><em>Copertura</em> is equated by <em>Deckung</em> in German and <em>couverture</em> in French. So in different areas, <em>copertura</em> means different things:</p><ul><li>Traditional Germanic school (as well as its Nordic and Middle European derivatives and the influenced Asian adherents and the American vocal pedagogy): <em>Deckung</em> (cover) demands sudden mechanical registration actions while there has always existed a reaction against “heavy covering”.</li><li>Current French School: <ul><li>historic French School: <em>couverture</em> = <em>copertura</em>.</li><li>Since World War II: influenced by <em>Deckung</em>.</li></ul></li><li>Great Britain: Great diversity of tonal ideals exist and the two extremes are<ul><li>“Cathedral tone”: “‘covering’ is not a concern because high levels of breath mixture in the tone have already reduced the upper partials in the singing voice.”</li><li>British-trained opera and concert singers: similar to the international operatic stage.</li></ul></li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a while since I set up this blog and I haven’t contributed any meaningful articles yet. Recently, I found a fascinating  book, <em>On the Art of Singing</em>, written by Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Miller_(singer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Miller</a>) who has also composed another famous book <em>The Structure of Singing</em>. The book is structured as a collection of different topics and deserved to read. So I decided to read one chapter and write the reading summary every few days. Hope this could be a good start of my blog.</p><a id="more"></a><p>The first chapter is called <em>Imagery and the Teaching of Singing</em>. The title attracts me very much because I was always interested in the relationship between the acoustic and physiologic explanation of singing and the traditional pedagogy. The imagery is quite an important part of teaching voice. I was kept being reminded by my voice teacher of many different imageries like “the mask”, “‘head’ voice”, “‘chest’ voice”, “singing forward”, “a sip of water in the mouth” and so on. Some of them are useful while the others are confusing. This chapter settles several of my confusions and here are the key points listed.</p><h3 id="Imagery"><a href="#Imagery" class="headerlink" title="Imagery"></a>Imagery</h3><ul><li>Imagery, like the mask, the third eye, and winding wheels, is useful in teaching. “However, it is mostly of value if it is associated with already established, repeatable functional freedom.” <ul><li>Comments: “Functional freedom” might refer to the comprehensive vocal techniques and funcions like the breath management, proper laryngeal and resonatory response, etc.</li></ul></li><li>The superimposition of imagery must be done <em>after</em> the singer has learned to coordinate different functions so that an image may be useful in unifying those functions. If not, the student might be confused. So imagery should not be part of the first steps in teaching the technical coordination of the singing. </li><li>Every singer could have his own private images. But no matter what the imagery is, it should be <strong>projected</strong> to established functions including both psychological and physical orientation.</li><li>“Many outstanding professional singers never use detailed physiologic or technical imagery. For them, imagery occurs only at the interpretative level. They maintain a <em>dual channel</em> of psychological and physical orientation in which the technical foundation that has already been established permits <em>imaginative textual and musical projection</em>. Imaging in singing should ideally be directed to the artistic realization of text, drama, and musical content, <strong>not</strong> to the control of physical aspects of vocal technique.”<ul><li>Comments: The same idea is expressed by Bartholomew in 1935 saying, “When imagery becomes so vivid that it is transferred into the physical field and used to explain physiologic and acoustic phenomena, it becomes extremely dubious, unreliable and even false It is this misuse which is largely responsible for the bitter controversies over vocal methods, as well as for their often comical expressions.” This is quite interesting because for me, as an amateur singer, most of the imageries I have experienced are physiologic or technical. My voice teacher keep trying to inspire me in training with imageries. In my understanding, the phsiologic and technical imageries are the measure of teaching instead of performance which need the <em>artistic imaging</em>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="Some-inspiring-points"><a href="#Some-inspiring-points" class="headerlink" title="Some inspiring points"></a>Some inspiring points</h3><ul><li>“Singing is largely a <strong>subjective</strong> action.”</li><li>“Singing results from a <em>gestalt (完型)</em> (an organized whole that is perceived as more than the sum of its parts) summons up previous experiences of physical coordination, proprioceptive sensation, and vocal sound.”<ul><li>Comments: Everything, especially the art, could results from a gestalt. Look at the music, the fine art and the architecture. It is even for science, technology and engineering.</li></ul></li><li>“The <em>gestalt</em> includes both directly controllable and non-controllable actions.”” </li><li>“Fine singers seldom analyze the things they do in performance. Instead, they depend on recall as to how they have done in well before.”<ul><li>Comments: singing is based on experiences. Like what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Lamperti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Giovanni Battista Lamperti</a> said, “Thought and muscle are schooled until instinct and reaction develop and take command. Then what was arbitrary becomes automatic.”</li></ul></li><li>“A good teacher must be able to objectify the components of performance and convey them to the student, regardless of the student’s vocal category.””</li><li>“There is an increasing realization that the voice as an instrument can best be trained through exact communicative language. For this we can thank the dissemination of factual information from interdisciplinary sources.”<ul><li>Comments: This is true. However, we should always notice that the art will never thrive without the imaging which though could be projected to specific technical functions.</li></ul></li><li>“<strong>Artistry can be only as complete as coordinated function permits</strong>.””</li><li>Functions and imaging<ul><li><em>Free function</em> permits <em>artistic imaging</em>; </li><li><em>Performance function</em> permits <em>physical imagery</em>; </li><li><em>Technical function</em> permits <em>technical imaging</em>.</li></ul></li></ul>]]></content>
